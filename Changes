Revision history for Software-Release-Watch

0.03     2014-08-16 (SHARYANTO) - Happy 19th CPAN Day!

         - [build] CLI scripts are now generated automatically using
           Dist::Zilla::Plugin::ScriptFromFunc. The plugin is still at 0.01 so the
           generated script is not as polished as it should be. Stay tuned.


0.02    2014-05-26 (SHARYANTO)

        - No functional changes.

        - Add 'use experimental smartmatch' for perl 5.18+ [CT].


0.01    2012-11-08 (SHARYANTO)

        - First release (proof of concept).
